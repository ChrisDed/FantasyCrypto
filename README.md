# FantasyCrypto

Fantasy Crypto is a platform that can help prepare people for the real cryptocurrency markets. Starting off with $50,000 virtual USD, users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies with tables showing key transaction information. This web application is intended for people very new to cryptocurrencies. The platform only contains coins offered at Coinbase, using their web API for real time buy and sell rates.

This web application was made as a quick prototype to a .NET desktop application I want to develop sometime in the future. It is a Node.js application with back end rendering using EJS. CRUD operations which create, update, and remove documents on MongoDB with authentication and authorization.
